# 🧩 Console Application Suite (Python)

This project is a combined console application built as part of my Python learning journey.
It connects multiple mini-projects into a single login-based system.

## 🎯 Objective

To learn how to connect multiple programs together using:

* Functions
* Dictionaries
* Loops and flow control
* Modular thinking
* Program structure like real applications

## 🔐 Features

### 1. Sign Up / Login System

* Username & password storage using dictionary
* Password strength checker before account creation
* Proper login validation

### 2. After Login Menu

User can choose:

* 🎮 Play KBC Quiz Game
* 🧮 Use Calculator
* 📝 Sentence Analyzer
* 🔐 Code / Decode Secret Message

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* Functions
* Nested loops and flow control
* Dictionaries for data management
* String methods
* Input validation
* Modular design (calling different functions from main menu)

## 📌 Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand:

* How large programs are structured
* How multiple features are connected in a single application
* Avoiding repetition using functions
* Designing user-driven programs
* And after i will get the laptop in 3 or 4 month then I will make the advance version of it and more precise and structured and more user engaging
